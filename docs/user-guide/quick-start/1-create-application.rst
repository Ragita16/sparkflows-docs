Step 1: Create Project
==============================

Before you can start creating a workflow, you will need to create a "Project" Project is a bucket where all your artifacts such as datasets, workflows, dashboards etc. related to a project would reside. Projects are equivalent to workspaces in IDEs. 

From the landing page of Fire Insights, click on `Create Project` to create a new project.
