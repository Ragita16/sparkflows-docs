Step 2 : Upload Data Files
===========================

The workflow needs data to work on. As a next step, you will upload a CSV file that you want to process in your workflow.

If your data in a CSV file, click on the "Data Browsers" and select "HDFS". Your home directory will be displayed. Initially, it will be empty as you have not uploaded any files.

To use CSV files in workflow, Fire Insights requires that you wrap them in datasets. In the next step, you will create datasets from the files you have just uploaded.
