Step 2 : Upload Data Files
===========================

The workflow needs data to work on. As the next step, you will upload a data file that you want to process in your workflow.

If your data is in a CSV file, click on 'Data' menu. Depending on the File Systems configured, you would see one or more of 'FileSystem', 'HDFS', 'DBFS', 'S3'. Select the appropriate one from the menu depending on where you want to upload your data files to.

To use CSV files in the workflow, Fire Insights requires that you wrap them in datasets. In the next step, you will create datasets from the files you have just uploaded.
