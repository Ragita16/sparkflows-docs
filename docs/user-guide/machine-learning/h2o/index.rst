   * - Title
     - Description
   * - H2ODRF
     - Distributed Random Forest (DRF) is a powerful classification and regression tool. When given a set of data, DRF generates a forest of classification or regression trees, rather than a single classification or regression tree.
   * - H2OKMeans
     - K-Means falls in the general category of clustering algorithms. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning that tries to find structures in the data without using any labels or target values. Clustering partitions a set of observations into separate groupings such that an observation in a given group is more similar to another observation in the same group than to another observation in a different group.
   * - H2OGBM
     - Gradient Boosting Machine (for Regression and Classification) is a forward learning ensemble method. The guiding heuristic is that good predictive results can be obtained through increasingly refined approximations. H2Oâ€™s GBM sequentially builds regression trees on all the features of the dataset in a fully distributed way - each tree is built in parallel.
   * - H2OGLRM
     - Generalized Low Rank Models (GLRM) is an algorithm for dimensionality reduction of a dataset. It is a general, parallelized optimization algorithm that applies to a variety of loss and regularization functions. Categorical columns are handled by expansion into 0/1 indicator columns for each level. With this approach, GLRM is useful for reconstructing missing values and identifying important features in heterogeneous data.
