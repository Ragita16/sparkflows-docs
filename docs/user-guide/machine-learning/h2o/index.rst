     - Description
   * - H2ODRF
     - Distributed Random Forest (DRF) is a powerful classification and regression tool. When given a set of data, DRF generates a forest of classification or regression trees, rather than a single classification or regression tree.
   * - H2OKMeans
     - K-Means falls in the general category of clustering algorithms. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning that tries to find structures in the data without using any labels or target values. Clustering partitions a set of observations into separate groupings such that an observation in a given group is more similar to another observation in the same group than to another observation in a different group.
