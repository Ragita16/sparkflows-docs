Classification
==============

Classification is a task that requires the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to assign a class label to examples from the problem domain. An easy to understand example is classifying emails as “spam” or “not spam.”

Classification predictive modeling involves assigning a class label to input examples.
Binary classification refers to predicting one of two classes and multi-class classification involves predicting one of more than two classes.
Multi-label classification involves predicting one or more classes for each example and imbalanced classification refers to classification tasks where the distribution of examples across the classes is not equal.
