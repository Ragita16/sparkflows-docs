Overview
==============

Machine Learning is one of the driving forces of AI. It denotes the ability of machines to learn, adapt and apply without being explicitly programmed. Well, there is a very clear difference between traditional programming and machine learning. In case of traditional programming, you have your algorithm coded or programmed in the computer system. You input data into your program in the computer and get the output. But there, an interesting thing happens in case of machine learning, Where your algorithm gets updated constantly by your input data and output data.

So how do machines learn? Almost like we humans learn. 

Letâ€™s look at the step by step process. There is a period of training where a machine is trained on real data representative of the problem to be solved. So, if you want your machine to identify spam emails, give it enough examples of text that is a spam and text that is not a spam. 

After training comes the validation. The algorithms are tested on real world data and the error is measured to derive the best fit algorithm. 

The algorithm is then finally tested and deployed. Feedback from live system is used to optimise the algorithm. 

The key component of a machine learning process is the training. How do you train machines? Think of how you teach children to recognise objects. So, if you want her to recognise cats, you show her photos of cats, or real cats and she soon starts knowing which is a cat; and that a dog is not a cat. 

The examples you show are like labelled data that is fed into a machine during a training process. The output is the model that is then deployed on to real world and works basis real data. Good machine learning algorithms never stop learning and will automatically be adjusting and adapting basis real world data. 

There are 3 major types of learning paradigms that can be used to develop ML models. 

Supervised learning learns basis labelled data, e.g. a chatbot is trained to recognise that Hi, Hello, Hey are all greeting words. 

Unsupervised learning works based on clustering data. For example, identifying similar resumes based on text patterns. 

Reinforcement learning helps a machine to learn through actual outcomes. E.g. understand the best chess moves by actually playing and winning or losing.
