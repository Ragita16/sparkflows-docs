Feature Selection With Importance
---------------------

The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. It scales well to large number of samples and has been used across a large range of application areas in many different fields.

Fire Insights provides two methods for doing Feature Selection.

  * Feature Selection using Correlation
  * Feature Selection using Feature Importance
