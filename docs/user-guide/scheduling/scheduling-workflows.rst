Scheduling Workflows
====================

Fire allows you to schedule workflows to be run at regular intervals.

The workflows page displays the list of various workflows.

Under ``Action`` column, there is an icon to schedule any given workflow.

Editing a Scheduled Workflow

You can edit a schedule by clicking on the edit icon, updating the new values and saving it.


Viewing Results of Workflow Executions

When workflows are scheduled, they are executed by Fire at the specified schedule.

The results of the execution of the workflows can be viewed in the Workflow Executions Page. This allows us to view the results of past execution, logs of the run etc.
