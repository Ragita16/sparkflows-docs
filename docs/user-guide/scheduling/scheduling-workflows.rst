Scheduling Workflows
====================

Fire allows you to schedule workflows to be run at regular intervals.

Scheduler Tab
-------------

The Scheduler Tab displays the various workflows scheduled.


Scheduling New Workflow
-----------------------

The workflows page displays the list of various workflows.

Under ``Action`` column, there is an icon to schedule any given workflow.


Viewing Results of Workflow Executions
--------------------------------------

When workflows are scheduled, they are executed by Fire at the specified schedule.

The results of the execution of the workflows can be viewed in the Workflow Executions Page. This allows us to view the results of past execution, logs of the run etc.
