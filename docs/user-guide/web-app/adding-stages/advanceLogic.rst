Advance Parameters Design
======================

In Parameters stage, We add ``select, text-field, select boxes, buttons, etc`` components. These elements have options to add condition and logic.

Condition
--------------

Condition is mostly used to show and hide component based on condition. There is two ways to apply condition, simple and advance.

For example: 

- In Simple condition user need to choose given option. 

   .. figure:: ../../../_assets/web-app/ConditionSimple.PNG
      :alt: web-app
      :width: 90%
      
- For Advance conditions user need to enter custom javascript code. User must assign the show variable a boolean result.

Logic
--------------

Logic is combination of trigger and action. User can add multiple logic for same component.

For example: 

- In Simple trigger user need to choose given option. 

   .. figure:: ../../../_assets/web-app/LogicSimple1.PNG
      :alt: web-app
      :width: 90%
      
 - For Javascript trigger user need to enter custom javascript code. Code return result variable.

  .. figure:: ../../../_assets/web-app/LogicJavascript.PNG
      :alt: web-app
      :width: 80%
      
  - Every logic has at least one action. Action return value variable.

      :width: 80%
