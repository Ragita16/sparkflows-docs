Pipeline
========

Fire supports Pipelines. Pipelines allow running workflows in defined order.

Configuring Pipelines
---------------------

Fire uses Apache Airflow for executing Pipelines. Hence Airflow has to be installed on the same machine as Fire.

Below are the configurations needed in Fire.
