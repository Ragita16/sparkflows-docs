Pipeline
========

Fire supports Pipelines. Pipelines allow running workflows in defined order.


Creating a Pipeline
--------------------

Each Application now allows creating Pipelines.

Below is an example Pipeline with 3 Workflows.

Executing a Pipeline
--------------------

Pipelines can be executed like workflows. When a Pipeline is executed, its execution is submitted to Airflow.

The Pipeline tab displays the list of Pipelines for the current Application.

Clicking on the ``Execute`` Action icon opens the Pipeline Execute Page.
