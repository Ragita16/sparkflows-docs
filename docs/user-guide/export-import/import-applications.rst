Select the Option for importing the Application
-----------------------------------------------

There are two options when importing Applications:

* Import to a New Application
    * In this case, the selected Application would be imported as a new Application in Fire Insights. 

* Import to an Existing Application

When importing to an existing Application, there are 3 possible methods to choose from:

* Create new workflows and datasets in matching UUID's found.

* Overwrite datasets and workflows if same UUID found.

* Delete all workflows and datasets in the selected Application and create the imported workflows and datasets as new ones.


On Success
-------------------------------

On successful import of the Application into Fire Insights, the success dialog is displayed along with the details of the import.
