Importing Applications
==============

Fire allows you to import Applications.

Below are the steps for importing Applications in Fire.

Go to the Applications Page

Select the name of project which are present in the uploaded zip file(Connectors) 


Select the project name from which the user has to import the data of connectors (May import in the same project or any other of the user's choice). 

There are three options to import projects- 

* Create new workflows and datasets. 

* Overwrite workflows and datasets if found.

* Delete all workflows and datasets and create a new one. 

Create new workflows and datasets
-------------------------------

* Connectors data from file. 

* Import to ETL. 

* The workflows and datasets which are present in ETL will remain as it is just, the new workflows and datasets will be created which are present in the Connectors (data present in the zip file). 



Datasets

Workflows

After successfully import, Import Information modal is shown with number of workflows and datasets count.

Overwrite workflows and datasets if found
---------------------------------------


If not found then, create a new one

     :width: 60%
     
     
* Connectors data from file. 

* Import to ETL. 

* It will check whether the workflows and datasets which are present in the folder (Connectors) are present in ETL or not if present then overwrite else create new (depending upon projectId and uuid it will check).

Datasets

     :alt: tutorials
     :align: center
     :width: 60%
     
If found then, overwrite  


* If I choose connectors and import to also connectors and the data (workflows and datasets) is present in the Project Connectors so it will overwrite not create new.

* After successfully import, Import Information modal is shown with number of workflows and datasets count.

Delete all workflows and datasets and create a new one

 Choose the appropriate options.

* Connectors data from file. 

* Import to ETL.

* It will delete all the workflows and datasets from ETL and create new.

* After deletion data will be shown-
