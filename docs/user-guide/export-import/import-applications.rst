Select the name of project which are present in the uploaded zip file(Connectors) 


Select the project name from which the user has to import the data of connectors (May import in the same project or any other of the user's choice). 

There are three options to import projects- 

* Create new workflows and datasets. 

* Overwrite workflows and datasets if found.

* Delete all workflows and datasets and create a new one.
