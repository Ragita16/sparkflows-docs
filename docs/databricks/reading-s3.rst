Reading S3 files
=========================

https://docs.databricks.com/_static/notebooks/data-import/s3.html

There are two ways in Databricks to read from S3. You can either read data using an IAM Role or read data using Access Keys.

Databricks recommends leveraging IAM Roles in Databricks.


Fire Insights allows you to browse your Data in S3 and create workflows using them. When the job is submitted to Databricks, the job reads data from the S3 location and processes them.

You can also create external tables in Databricks over data in S3. Fire Insights can process data from Databricks tables.
