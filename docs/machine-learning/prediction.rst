Prediction
============

Prediction is to identify data points purely on the description of another related data value. It is not necessarily related to future events but the used variables are unknown. Prediction derives the relationship between a thing you know and a thing you need to predict for future reference.

What is Prediction?
--------------------
- Predicting the identity of one thing based purely on the description of another, relatedthing
- Not necessarily future events, just unknowns
- Based on the relationship between a thing that you can know and a thing you need to predict

Predictor => Predicted
-----------------------
• When building a predictive model, you have data covering both
• When using one, you have data describing the predictor and you want it to tell you the predicted value

Usual Examples
--------------
• Predicting levels of sales that will result from a price change or advert.
• Predicting whether or not it will rain based on current humidity
• Predicting the colour of a pottery glaze based on a mixture of base pigments
• Predicting how far up the charts a single will go
• Predicting how much revenue a book of debt will bring

Techniques
----------
• Most prediction techniques are based on mathematical models:
– Simple statistical models such as regression
– Non-linear statistics such as power series
– Neural networks, RBFs, etc
• All based on fitting a curve through the data, that is, finding a relationship from the predictors to the predicted
