Model Save/Load
================

Fire Insights allows you to save the ML Model created.

Spark ML models are saved into a directory with multiple files in it.

H2O Models can be saved in binary format or in MOJO format.

The ML Models can be loaded in the same or other workflows to be used for scoring. The ML Models can also be downloaded from HDFS Browse.
