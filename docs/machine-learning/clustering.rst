Clustering
==========

Apache Spark provides a number of Algorithms for Clustering.

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-clustering.html

- K-means
- Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
- Bisecting k-means
- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)


Fire Insights provides processors for the following clustering algorithms so that they can be seamlessly used in a workflow.

K-means
-------

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-clustering.html#k-means

k-means is one of the most commonly used clustering algorithms that clusters the data points into a predefined number of clusters. The MLlib implementation includes a parallelized variant of the k-means++ method called kmeans||.

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
---------------------------------

https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-clustering.html#latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda

LDA is implemented as an Estimator that supports both EMLDAOptimizer and OnlineLDAOptimizer, and generates a LDAModel as the base model. Expert users may cast a LDAModel generated by EMLDAOptimizer to a DistributedLDAModel if needed.
