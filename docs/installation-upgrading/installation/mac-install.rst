Fire can run independently on any machine, since we package Apache Spark along with or it can be connected to a Spark cluster.

If Sparkflows Fire needs to be connected to a Spark Cluster, install it on an edge node of the cluster. The edge node has the hadoop binaries and spark configs.

Prerequisites
-------------

  * JDK 1.7+ installed.
  * java and jar have to be in the PATH
  * If running on a Spark cluster, Spark 1.6+ is needed on the cluster.
  * 3GB+ of RAM.


Quick Installation Steps of Fire with H2 DB
-------------------------------------------

  * Download and unpack  :  fire-1.4.2.tgz
  * Create H2 DB

      ./run-fire-server.sh start

  * Open your web browser and navigate to: <machine_name>:8080/index.html.
