Installation
============

Fire is built to be lightweight, secure and powerful. It can be setup to run:

* In standalone mode on a MacOS, Linux or Windows machine
* On an edge node of an Apache Spark cluster. In this case the jobs would be submitted and run on the Apache Spark Cluster.

Fire stores its metadata in a Relational Store. It can be H2 or MySQL.
