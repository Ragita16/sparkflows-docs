Clustering Houses
=================

This workflow reads in a dataset. It then Performs KMeans Clustering on the Housing Dataset.

Worklow
-------

Below is the workflow. It does the following:

* Reads data from a sample dataset.
* prints the results.
* Assemble the features for predictions.
* Split it.
* Perform KMeans Clustering.
* ML Model save.
* ML Model Load.
* Prediction.
* Print the prediction results.
