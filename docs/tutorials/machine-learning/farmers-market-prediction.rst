Farmers Market Prediction
=========================

It demonstrate to predict "the number of farmer's markets in a given zip code‚Äù based on the income and taxes paid in a given area using the past data.It seems plausible that areas with higher income have more farmer's markets simply because there is more of a market for those goods. Of course there are many potential holes in this idea, but that's part of the desire to test it.

DataBricks has published a clean approach to build this use case. It feature a Python notebook that demonstrates how to create ML Pipeline to preprocess a dataset, train a Machine Learning model, and make predictions.

Using Fire Insights visual designer, You can try to execute this approach visually and declaratively. This note speaks to that.

As the DataBricks link highlights:

- The first of the two datasets that we will be working with is the Farmers Markets Directory and Geographic Data. This dataset contains information on the longitude and latitude, state, address, name, and zip code of Farmers Markets in the United States. The raw data is published by the Department of Agriculture. The version on the data that is found in Databricks (and is used in this tutorial) was updated by the Department of Agriculture on Dec 01, 2015.

- The second we will be working with is the SOI Tax Stats - Individual Income Tax Statistics - ZIP Code Data (SOI). This study provides detailed tabulations of individual income tax return data at the state and ZIP code level and is provided by the IRS. This repository only has a sample of the data: 2013 and includes "AGI". The ZIP Code data show selected income and tax items classified by State, ZIP Code, and size of adjusted gross income. Data are based on individual income tax returns filed with the IRS and are available for Tax Years 1998, 2001, 2004 through 2013. The data include items, such as:

 -Number of returns, which approximates the number of households
 -Number of personal exemptions, which approximates the population
 -Adjusted gross income
 -Wages and salaries
 -Dividends before exclusion
 -Interest received
