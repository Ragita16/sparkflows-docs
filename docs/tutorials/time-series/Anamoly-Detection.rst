Anamoly Detection for IOT Devices
=================================


Objective
---------
Anomaly detection issue for time arrangement can be planned as discovering exception information guides relative toward some norm or common sign. Our center will be from a machine persopective, for example, surprising spikes, level move highlighting disintegrating soundness of a machine.

Dataset
--------

Dataset contains 4 columns as follows:-

* Datetime - 10 mins time interval of accelerometer data
* 4-Bearings - Contains reading of devices


Anamoly Detection using Prophet Time Series Model Workflow
-----------------------------------------------------------

Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends fit with yearly, weekly, daily, seasonality and holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Time-series anomaly detection is a feature used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called outliers.
