Inventory management is a methodical way to deal with sourcing, putting away, and selling inventoryâ€”both crude materials (segments) and completed merchandise (items). In business terms, inventory management implies the correct stock, at the correct levels, in the opportune spot, at the ideal time, and at the correct expense just as cost.
