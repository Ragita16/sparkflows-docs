Earthquake Prediction
=================

Objective
---------
As the motivation behind earthquake prediction is to empower crisis measures to decrease demise and devastation, inability to give notice of a significant earthquake that happens, or possibly a satisfactory assessment of the hazard, can bring about legitimate risk, or even political cleansing.
