Could not connect to fire
------------------

When double clicking on a node in the editor it shows "Could not connect to Fire".

If Fire is configured to submit job to a cluster with spark-submit, first try to ensure you are able to submit jobs to the cluster with spark-submit

Make sure to set SPARK_HOME and add spark/bin to your PATH.
